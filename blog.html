                    </h2>
                    <p>I've had a fascination with technology and gadgets for a long time, but it wasn't until fairly recent that I considered learning computer programming. While my job in the healthcare industry was rewarding, I felt the need to learn something new. A couple of years ago, my interest turned to smartphone apps. I felt that there was either a need to improve some apps that were already on the market or apps that I wanted simply did not exist. I wanted to change that. I didn't know where to begin to learn how to make an app, but several months ago my mom heard a news story about Google partnering up with a school to provide curriculum to teach people how to develop Android apps. That's when we discovered General Assembly. After some research, we found that the course was designed to teach anyone with or without programming experience. Once I learned that, I decided that I had to do it.</p>
                    <p>After being accepted into the Android Development Immersive program, I quit my job and began the full-time classes in April. Having been out of school for a long time, I knew that it was going to be difficult. I still wasn't quite prepared for how challenging it would be. In the beginning, I would describe it as learning to speak a new language and having to write an essay or a novel in that language within a couple of weeks. It was a struggle. I spent about 12+ hours on campus most days in class, working on labs or projects, and avoiding traffic on the dreaded 405. A good chunk of my weekends were spent catching up on sleep out of sheer exhaustion from the week. Towards the end of the program, I realized how much I had learned and began to hit my stride. </p>
                    <p>All the sacrifices were worth it because I have picked up so many programming skills.
                    Now that I have graduated from the program, I have a solid basis on which to master Android development and begin to learn many other programming languages. In my previous roles, I enjoyed helping people and I hope to continue to help even more people in a different capacity. I look forward to continuing on this path and evolving with technology. </p>
